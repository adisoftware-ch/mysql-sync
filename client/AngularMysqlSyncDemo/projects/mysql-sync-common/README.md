# MysqlSyncCommon

## Intention

npm library for usage of mysql-sync from AngluarNG or ionic applications. The library provides the interface definitions for data exchange between mysql-sync-server and mysql-sync-client. It's therefore required to be present in node_modules of the client- as well as of the server-project.

## Building the Library

- Run `ng build mysql-sync-common` from the project root directory (./client/AngularMysqlSyncDemo)
- Copy `./client/AngularMysqlSyncDemo/dist/mysql-sync-common` (whole folder) to `node_modules` of your AngularNG or ionic project
- Copy `./client/AngularMysqlSyncDemo/dist/mysql-sync-common` (whole folder) to `node_modules` of your mysql-sync-server project

## Todo
